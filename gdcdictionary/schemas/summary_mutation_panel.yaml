      No': Nonsynonymous SNPs that do not have high confidence of association with drug resistance as determined by analysis performed by ReSeqTB or are not listed in ReSeqTB. 'Yes': Nonsynonymous SNPs with high confidence of association with drug resistance as determined by analysis performed by ReSeqTB.
